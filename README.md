# Marketing-Customer-Segmentation

A company is trying to get to know its customers better. The goal is for your company to create a more appropriate and efficient marketing strategy for each customer. One of the techniques that can be done to get to know their customers better is to do customer segmentation.

That is by grouping existing customers based on the similarity of the characters of these customers. To do this, we will use unsupervised machine learning techniques. One of the techniques that can be used is the application of machine learning using the K-Prototypes algorithm. The K-Prototypes algorithm is a combination of K-Means and K-Modes that can be used to segment data.
